# Robot-Collision-Detection-A-Algorithm
This MATLAB project simulates a multi-robot navigation system using the A pathfinding algorithm*. The robots move on a grid-based map with randomly placed obstacles, while detecting potential collisions and adhering to velocity constraints. The simulation visualizes robot movement and detects collisions in real-time.
